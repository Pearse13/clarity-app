Key Progress & Issues:

Initial Problem:
- Back button after login led to Auth0 Universal Login page
- Navigation history wasn't clean after authentication

Solutions Attempted:
- Modified Auth0 login parameters to prevent multiple dialogs
- Tried various history manipulation approaches
- Implemented history replacement strategies
- Added Auth0 callback handling improvements

Current State:
- We have an oscillation between states
- This suggests our history manipulation is creating a cycle between states

Next Steps:
- Need to resolve the oscillation issue
- Focus on preventing Auth0 from adding entries to history
- Ensure clean navigation state after authentication

Server Start Issues:
- Attempted to start frontend and backend servers
- PowerShell '&&' operator not supported
