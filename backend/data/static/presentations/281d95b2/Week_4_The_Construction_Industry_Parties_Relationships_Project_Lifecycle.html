<p><b>Supply</b></p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>▪</p>
<p>We saw last week how the demand curve shows what </p>
<p>consumers are willing and able to purchase at each and every </p>
<p>price, all other things being unchanged.</p>
<p>▪</p>
<p>This is only one part of the market, concerned with <i><b>buyers.</b></i></p>
<p>▪</p>
<p>We have yet to consider the role of <i><b>sellers </b></i>(i.e. businesses </p>
<p>which could include estate agents, development companies, </p>
<p>construction firms) <i><b>–</b></i> this involves an analysis of supply and </p>
<p>the supply side of the industry.</p>
<p><b>Introduction to Supply</b></p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>▪</p>
<p>The supply of a product is the amount that producers are </p>
<p><i><b>willing </b></i>and <i><b>able</b></i> to produce at each and every price, all other </p>
<p>things being unchanged (Gillespie, p. 107)</p>
<p>e.g. The supply curve might show how many houses a </p>
<p>construction firm would be willing and able to produce at </p>
<p>different prices. </p>
<p>▪</p>
<p>The supply curve is usually upward sloping (bottom left to top </p>
<p>right); therefore, a higher price is usually needed for firms to </p>
<p>be willing and able to produce more.</p>
<p>▪</p>
<p>As the price increases, it becomes more appealing / feasible </p>
<p>to produce more units.</p>
<p><b>Features of a Supply Curve</b></p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>▪</p>
<p>Businesses usually need a higher price to cover the extra </p>
<p>costs of producing extra units.</p>
<p>▪</p>
<p>An increase in price (from P1 - P2) will usually lead to an </p>
<p>increase in the quantity supplied (from Q1 - Q2), known </p>
<p>as an <b>extension of supply </b>(Gillespie, p. 106)<b>:</b></p>
<p><b>Movement along a Supply Curve</b></p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>If, on the other hand, there were a fall in the price (from P1 -</p>
<p>P2), this would result in a fall in (<b>contraction of</b>) the </p>
<p>quantity supplied (from Q1 – Q2)</p>
<p><b>Movement along a Supply Curve</b></p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>A shift in supply means that the curve moves to the right or </p>
<p>left, meaning that more or fewer products are supplied at </p>
<p>each and every price (Gillespie pp. 110-1)</p>
<p><b>Shift in supply curve</b></p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>▪</p>
<p>As we saw in the case of demand, the principles are:</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>A change in <i><b>quantity supplied </b></i>is caused by a change in price; whereas </p>
<p>-</p>
<p>A change or shift in <i><b>supply </b></i>is caused by a change in other factors</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>▪</p>
<p>These other factors include:</p>
<p>▪</p>
<p><i><b>A change in the number of producers –</b></i> if there is an increase in this </p>
<p>number, it would lead to an increase in supply, i.e. an outward shift in the </p>
<p>curve – to the right.</p>
<p>▪</p>
<p><i><b>A change in technology</b></i> – new, better technology should enable firms to </p>
<p>produce more output at any price, thus also shifting the curve to the right. </p>
<p>(e.g. online trading, in construction modular and off-site building, BIM)</p>
<p>▪</p>
<p><i><b>A change in costs –</b></i> An increase in wages / price of materials would mean </p>
<p>that firms could not supply as much at a given price because of higher </p>
<p>costs – they will need a higher price for any given level of output. Thus the </p>
<p>curve would shift to the left (e.g. price of oil, transportation costs, etc).</p>
<p><b>Factors that cause shift in supply</b></p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>▪</p>
<p>These other factors also include:</p>
<p>▪</p>
<p><i><b>A change in indirect taxes. </b></i>(Gillespie pp. 110-2). If a tax, such </p>
<p>as VAT, is levied on a good this will increase the selling price </p>
<p>of any given output (as producers seek to recover this </p>
<p>additional cost through higher prices). </p>
<p><i><b>e.g in relation to construction; a landfill tax would increase </b></i></p>
<p><i><b>construction costs and reduce supply at each and every price </b></i></p>
<p><i><b>(cause curve to shift to left). Other statutory health and safety </b></i></p>
<p><i><b>legislations which are perhaps costly to the industry, might </b></i></p>
<p><i><b>have a similar effect.</b></i></p>
<p>▪</p>
<p><i><b>A change in weather conditions. </b></i>This can be relevant in </p>
<p>certain markets, such as agriculture / construction where </p>
<p>there are market exposures to changes in the natural </p>
<p>environment. Poor weather can lead to supply shocks which </p>
<p>shift the supply curve to the left. </p>
<p><b>Factors that cause shift in supply</b></p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>(Gillespie p. 113). The industry supply curve is the total </p>
<p>supplied by all the firms in the industry at each and every </p>
<p>price, derived from the horizontal summation of all the firms’ </p>
<p>supply curves:</p>
<p><b>Industry Supply</b></p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>▪</p>
<p>The slope of a supply curve will depend on how sensitive </p>
<p>it is to changes in price (Gillespie p.116)</p>
<p>▪</p>
<p>The price elasticity of supply measures the extent to </p>
<p>which the quantity supplied in a market varies with a </p>
<p>change in price:</p>
<p>Price elasticity of supply </p>
<p>=  % change in quantity supplied</p>
<p>% change in price</p>
<p>As in the case of demand, the two key elements to understanding </p>
<p>elasticity of supply are</p>
<p>:</p>
<p>-</p>
<p><i><b>The sign of the answer </b></i>(usually positive; price increase </p>
<p>→</p>
<p>increase in quantity </p>
<p>supplied)</p>
<p>-</p>
<p><i><b>The size of the answer</b></i>, which measures the strength of the relationship (if &gt;1, </p>
<p>then supply is elastic, if &lt;1 inelastic)</p>
<p><b>Price Elasticity of Supply</b></p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>▪</p>
<p>The formula tells us the relative amount by which quantity </p>
<p>supplied will change in relation to price changes. </p>
<p>▪</p>
<p>For example, if there is a 10% increase in house prices and </p>
<p>this leads to a 1 per cent increase in the quantity of housing </p>
<p>supplied, the price elasticity = (1/10) = 0.1. This is a very small </p>
<p>response so the supply would be considered to be relatively </p>
<p>price inelastic.</p>
<p>▪</p>
<p>As in the case of demand, there are three broad categories:</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Price-inelastic supply: Where the value &lt;1, as in example above supply is </p>
<p>said to be ‘inelastic’. </p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Price-elastic supply: Where the value &gt;1, supply is said to be elastic; </p>
<p>occurs where % change in supply is larger than % change in price.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Unitary-elastic supply: Where the value = 1, a % change in price would </p>
<p>lead to an identical % change in quantity supplied – unlikely in reality.</p>
<p><b>Price Elasticity of Supply</b></p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p><b>Extreme cases of price elasticity of supply</b></p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>▪</p>
<p>The example given to demonstrate price elasticity outlined </p>
<p>a scenario where a 10% increase in house prices was </p>
<p>associated with a 1% increase in the quantity of housing </p>
<p>supplied.</p>
<p>▪</p>
<p>This is a hypothetical example. However, supply <i>is</i> likely </p>
<p>to be relatively price inelastic within the construction </p>
<p>industry because: </p>
<p>- Barker Review (2003) suggested figure of 0.5 for UK </p>
<p>construction industry</p>
<p>- Supply is fixed in short term</p>
<p>- Lags exist due to time involved in site identification, </p>
<p>acquisition, negotiating planning permission, construction…</p>
<p>- Time is main determinant of price elasticity……</p>
<p><b>‘In the Real World’</b></p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>Example just considered helps demonstrate how elasticity can vary over </p>
<p>time (Gillespie p. 118): Over a longer period of time, resources can be </p>
<p>more easily shifted from one sector to another, in the short term at least </p>
<p>one factor of production is fixed, restricting firms’ ability to respond to </p>
<p>price changes</p>
<p><b>Elasticity of Supply over time</b></p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>

<p><b>&amp; </b></p>
<p><b>Profit Maximisation</b></p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p><b>Cost of Production</b></p>
<p>“the sum of all expenses necessarily incurred in the process </p>
<p>of creating and delivering a product or service”</p>
<p>Expenses can include raw materials, labour, equipment, </p>
<p>rent, overhead and marketing costs.</p>
<p><b>What is Cost?</b></p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p><b>Total Costs</b></p>
<p>Fixed costs, variable costs and other costs.</p>
<p><b>Fixed Costs</b></p>
<p>Costs that do not vary (increase or decrease) with output.</p>
<p><b>Variable Costs</b></p>
<p>Costs relating to how much (the quantity) of a product that </p>
<p>is produced (e.g raw materials)</p>
<p><b>Marginal Cost</b></p>
<p>The cost of producing an extra unit of the product or service</p>
<p><b>What Types of Costs?</b></p>
<p>Myers, p.98</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p><b>Fixed, Variable and Total Costs</b></p>
<p>Myers, p.98</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p><b>Short Run Costs</b></p>
<p>Short run cost curves tend to be U </p>
<p>shaped because of diminishing returns.</p>
<p>In the short run, capital is fixed. After a </p>
<p>certain point, increasing extra workers </p>
<p>leads to declining productivity. </p>
<p>Therefore, as you employ more workers </p>
<p>the marginal cost increases.</p>
<p>Because the short run marginal cost curve is sloped like this, mathematically the </p>
<p>average cost curve will be U shaped. Initially, average costs fall.  But, when </p>
<p>marginal cost is above the average cost, then average cost starts to rise.</p>
<p>Marginal cost always passes through the lowest point of the average cost curve.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p><b>Summary of ATC, AVC &amp; MC</b></p>
<p>Myers, p.98</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>•</p>
<p> ATC (Average Total Cost) = Total Cost / Quantity</p>
<p>•</p>
<p> AVC (Average Variable Cost) = Variable Cost / Quantity</p>
<p>•</p>
<p> AFC (Average Fixed Cost) = Fixed Cost / Quantity</p>
<p><b>Average Total, Variable &amp; Fixed Costs</b></p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p><b>Fixed Costs &amp; Average Total Cost &amp; Marginal Cost</b></p>
<p>Fixed costs (FC)  remain constant.</p>
<p>Therefore, the more you produce, the </p>
<p>lower the average fixed costs will be.</p>
<p>To work out the Marginal Cost (MC), </p>
<p>you determine how much Total Cost </p>
<p>(TC) has increased by.</p>
<p>For example, the third unit sees TC </p>
<p>increase from 450 to 500, therefore, </p>
<p>the increase in MC is 50.</p>
<p>The 12th unit sees TC rise from 1,700 </p>
<p>to 2,400, so the MC is 700.</p>

<p><b>Revenue</b></p>
<p>“the amount of money brought into the company, typically for selling </p>
<p>goods, products or services”.</p>
<p><b>Business Revenue</b></p>
<p>“the total amount of money brought in to the company by a company’s </p>
<p>operations, measured over a set period of time”.</p>
<p><b>Marginal Revenue – central concept in microeconomics</b></p>
<p>“the additional total revenue generated by increasing product sales by 1 </p>
<p>unit or the increase in revenue from the sale of one additional unit of </p>
<p>product”.</p>
<p><b>Marginal revenue (MR) =  Δ TR/Δ Q</b></p>
<p>If a firm sells an extra 50 units and sees an increase in revenue of </p>
<p>£200. Then the marginal revenue of each extra unit sold is £4.</p>
<p><b>What is Revenue?</b></p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p><b>Total, Average &amp; Marginal Revenue</b></p>
<p>This shows the price (P), quantity (Q), </p>
<p>total revenue (TR) average revenue (AR) </p>
<p>and marginal revenue (MR).</p>
<p>If the firm cuts the price from £7 to £6, </p>
<p>quantity increases to 5. Total revenue </p>
<p>increases by two. Therefore, the </p>
<p>marginal revenue is two.</p>
<p>If the firm cuts price from £3 to £2, total </p>
<p>revenue falls by six. Therefore, the </p>
<p>marginal revenue is  -6.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p><b>Revenue Maximisation</b></p>
<p>If a firm wished to maximise revenue, it </p>
<p>can use marginal revenue to guide its </p>
<p>decision. If marginal revenue is positive, </p>
<p>the total revenue is increasing.</p>
<p>If marginal revenue is negative, total </p>
<p>revenue is decreasing.</p>
<p>In this example, revenue is maximised at </p>
<p>a quantity of 5.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p><b>Normal Profit</b></p>
<p>“a minimum level of reward required to ensure that existing </p>
<p>entrepreneurs are prepared to remain in their present area </p>
<p>of production”.</p>
<p><b>Formula:</b></p>
<p>Profits = total revenues – total costs.</p>
<p><b>Economists formula:</b></p>
<p>Economic Profit = total revenues – total opportunity cost of </p>
<p>all inputs used.</p>
<p><b>Profit</b></p>
<p>Myers, p.98</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p><b>Profit</b></p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p><b>Profit Maximisation</b></p>
<p>To maximise profits, a firm needs to </p>
<p>consider both marginal revenue and </p>
<p>marginal cost.</p>
<p>If marginal revenue is greater than </p>
<p>marginal cost, then total profits will be </p>
<p>increasing.</p>
<p>Profit will be maximised at the point </p>
<p>where MR=MC</p>
<p>In the real world, an airline may sell </p>
<p>some last-minute tickets for a very low </p>
<p>price. The marginal revenue may be </p>
<p>quite low. However, the marginal cost of </p>
<p>selling empty seats on a plane is also </p>
<p>quite low.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p><b>Relationship Between AR &amp; MR</b></p>
<p>If the firm is a price taker, its demand curve will be perfectly elastic. In this case, the </p>
<p>marginal revenue will be the same as the price and average revenue.</p>
<p>If the price is £5, then the addition to revenue (MR) for selling an extra good, will </p>
<p>always be equal to the price £5.</p>
<p>In perfect competition, the marginal revenue is the same as the average revenue.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p><b>Marginal Revenue in Monopoly Market</b></p>
<p>When a firm faces a downward-sloping </p>
<p>demand curve, then marginal revenue </p>
<p>will be less than average revenue and </p>
<p>can even be negative.</p>
<p>This is because, if a firm cuts price, it gets </p>
<p>a lower average price but also loses </p>
<p>revenue it could otherwise have made </p>
<p>from selling units at a higher price.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p><b>Marginal Revenue &amp; Elasticity</b></p>
<p>When marginal revenue is positive. It </p>
<p>means a cut in price will increase total </p>
<p>revenue. This means that demand is </p>
<p>price elastic (% change in demand </p>
<p>greater than % change in price).</p>
<p>However, if a firm cuts price and </p>
<p>marginal revenue is negative (total </p>
<p>revenue falls). This implies that demand </p>
<p>is price inelastic. (% change in demand </p>
<p>less than % change in price)</p>
<p>At quantity of 6, where MR = 0, at this </p>
<p>point, PED = 1 (unitary elasticity)</p>
<p>This shows the elasticity of demand for a </p>
<p>straight-line demand curve varies.</p>

<p>–</p>
<p>To invest or spend – timing of spending matters to people but not in </p>

<p>–</p>
<p>Borrowing/lending interest rate represents the opportunity cost to the </p>
<p>shareholder of making investments in projects.</p>
<p>–</p>
<p>Opportunity cost of finance – the existence of a facility to borrow or to </p>
<p>lend means that those who have cash but do not want to spend have </p>
<p>opportunity to lend at the interest rate as an alternative to investing.</p>
<p>–</p>
<p>Investments in projects must therefore compete with that opportunity </p>
<p>and, to be desirable, produce returns in excess of the interest rate.</p>
