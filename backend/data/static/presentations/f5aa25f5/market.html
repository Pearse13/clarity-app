<p><b>1. Market equilibrium</b></p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p><b>Markets and equilibrium</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>So far we have considered the separate concepts of demand </p>
<p>and supply. </p>
<p></p>
<p>This first part of the lecture will examine the <i><b>price mechanism </b></i></p>
<p><i><b>(also known as market mechanism), </b></i>how this brings about </p>
<p><i><b>equilibrium </b></i>and the effects of changes in supply and demand </p>
<p>on the market price and quantity.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This will enable us to examine how the free market solves the </p>
<p>basic economic problems and draw a comparison with a </p>
<p>planned economy.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p><b>Markets and equilibrium</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>A <b>market </b>occurs when buyers and sellers interact to exchange </p>
<p>goods and services (whether physical or online).</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Equilibrium </b>(Gillespie p. 125) occurs in a market when the </p>
<p>quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded (Demand = </p>
<p>Supply) and there is no incentive for this position to change.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p><b>Equilibrium in a Free Market</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>In a <b>free market </b>equilibrium is reached by changes in the </p>
<p><b>price</b>. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Decisions of producers and consumers are made </p>
<p>independently of each other; the price mechanism acts to </p>
<p>bring these decisions together and to equate the quantity </p>
<p>supplied and demanded.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As demand or supply conditions change the price will adjust to </p>
<p>bring about a new equilibrium price and quantity.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So, how does this work?</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p><b>Price mechanism in the Free Market</b></p>
<p>In the free market the price mechanism is acting as:</p>
<p><b>A signal and incentive; </b>as the price rises this acts as a signal to other </p>
<p>producers (on the supply side of an industry) that this is an industry they </p>
<p>might want to enter to earn high or higher profits (<i>e.g. residential housing </i></p>
<p><i>market during a peak period</i>), and</p>
<p><b>A rationing device; </b>as the price increases it reduces the quantity </p>
<p>demanded until it equals the quantity supplied.</p>
<p><b> i.e. Due to <i>Price Mechanism </b></i>&amp; <i><b>Law of Market Forces</i>:</b></p>
<p>•</p>
<p>When there is a shortage of goods, the price rises.</p>
<p>•</p>
<p>When there is a surplus of goods, the price falls.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p><b>Porter’s Five Forces</b></p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p><b>Shortage</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Shortage</b></p>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p>occurs when the quantity demanded exceeds the </p>
<p>quantity supplied:</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p><b>Surplus</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Surplus </b></p>
<p>occurs when the quantity supplied exceeds the </p>
<p>quantity demanded: </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p><b>Example of Equilibrium</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Consider the following simple example:</p>
<p></p>
<p>The demand and supply for bottled water is as follows:</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p><b>Example of Equilibrium</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Market equilibrium occurs at the intersection of the </p>
<p>demand curve and the supply curve (where D=S) at </p>
<p>Point 1 </p>
<p></p>
<p>We can identify the equilibrium price &amp; quantity </p>
<p>demanded at this point:</p>
<p>-</p>
<p> The equilibrium price is $1 a bottle</p>
<p>-</p>
<p> The equilibrium quantity is 10 million bottles (per day)</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p><b>Effect of Increase in Demand</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Imagine now that a new study shows that drinking tap water is </p>
<p>unsafe. How do you think this might affect the Equilibrium </p>
<p>price &amp; quantity?</p>
<p></p>
<p>- There will be a change in demand for bottled water (a shift in </p>
<p>the demand curve)</p>
<p></p>
<p>- How do we show this on the Demand &amp; Supply graph?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Demand will increase at each and every price, thus the curve </p>
<p>will shift to the right, resulting in an increase in the price and </p>
<p>the quantity supplied.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p><b>Increase in Demand</b></p>
<p><b>1. </b>An increase in demand shifts the </p>
<p>demand curve rightward (from D0 </p>
<p>to D1).</p>
<p><b>3. </b>The quantity supplied increases </p>
<p>along the supply curve.</p>
<p><b>4. </b>Equilibrium quantity now </p>
<p>increases to 11m bottles per </p>
<p>day.</p>
<p><b>2. </b>At $1.00 a bottle, there is a shortage, </p>
<p>so the price rises to $1.50.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p><b>Fall in Demand</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Now imagine that a new zero calorie sports drink is invented.</p>
<p></p>
<p>- How will this affect the demand for bottled water?</p>
<p></p>
<p>- The sports drink is a substitute for water so you would expect </p>
<p>a fall in demand; demand curve shifts to the left.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p><b>Fall in Demand</b></p>
<p><b>1. </b>A decrease in demand shifts the </p>
<p>demand curve leftward (D0 to D2).</p>
<p><b>2. </b>At $1.00 a bottle, there is a surplus, </p>
<p>so the price falls to $0.75.</p>
<p><b>3. </b>Quantity supplied decreases along </p>
<p>the supply curve.</p>
<p><b>4. </b>Equilibrium quantity decreases to </p>
<p>9m bottles per day.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p><b>A Change in Supply</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Now consider the effect of a change in supply.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Imagine that a number of European producers of bottled </p>
<p>water buy springs and open plants in the US.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This will increase the supply of bottled water in the US, thus </p>
<p>the curve shifts to the right.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p><b>Increase in Supply</b></p>
<p><b>1. </b>An increase in supply shifts the </p>
<p>supply curve rightward (S0 to S1).</p>
<p><b>2. </b>At $1 a bottle, there is a surplus, so </p>
<p>the price falls to $0.75.</p>
<p><b>3. </b>Quantity demanded increases along </p>
<p>the demand curve.</p>
<p><b>4. </b>Equilibrium quantity increases </p>
<p>to 11m.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p><b>Growing Supply in the ‘Real World’</b></p>
<p>•</p>
<p>‘Expectations of future oil supply key to explaining drop in price’ (June 2015)</p>
<p>•</p>
<p>Between June 2014 and January 2019, the price of crude oil fell by nearly 60%, </p>
<p>one of the three largest falls since the 1970s.  Even after the recovery in recent </p>
<p>months, oil prices remain around 50% lower.</p>
<p>      There are three potential explanations for the fall in prices:</p>
<p>•</p>
<p>Rapid increase in the actual supply of oil due to the resumption of Libyan </p>
<p>production and the ongoing US shale-oil production boom, </p>
<p>•</p>
<p>Higher future supply of oil due to the decision by OPEC in November not to cut </p>
<p>production despite plummeting prices. Many market participants saw this as a </p>
<p>signal that the OPEC was willing to tolerate lower prices, perhaps in an effort to </p>
<p>undercut high-cost oil production like shale-oil.</p>
<p>•</p>
<p>Slowing prospects for global growth, suggesting a weaker outlook for oil </p>
<p>demand.</p>

<p>oil-supply-key-to-explaining-drop-in-price/</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p><b>Decrease in Supply</b></p>
<p>Finally, consider the case where there is a drought and supply </p>
<p>curve shifts to the left:</p>
<p><b>1. </b>A decrease in supply shifts the </p>
<p>supply curve leftward (S0 to S2).</p>
<p><b>2. </b>At $1.00 a bottle, there is a </p>
<p>shortage, so the price rises to </p>
<p>$1.50.</p>
<p><b>3. </b>Quantity demanded decreases </p>
<p>along the demand curve.</p>
<p><b>4. </b>Equilibrium quantity decreases to </p>
<p>9m</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p><b>Summary</b></p>
<p><i>    </i></p>
<p><i>Assuming a downward sloping demand curve and </i></p>
<p><i>upward sloping supply curve:</i></p>
<p></p>
<p>An <b>outward shift in demand </b>increases the </p>
<p>equilibrium price and quantity</p>
<p></p>
<p>An <b>inward shift in demand </b>decreases the </p>
<p>equilibrium price and quantity</p>
<p></p>
<p>An <b>outward shift in supply </b>decreases the </p>
<p>equilibrium price and increases the equilibrium </p>
<p>quantity</p>
<p></p>
<p>An <b>inward shift in supply </b>increases the equilibrium </p>
<p>price and decreases the equilibrium quantity</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p><b>Effect of indirect taxes &amp; subsidies</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><i>Indirect Taxes, </i>e.g. VAT, increase the prices paid by buyers </p>
<p>and lower the prices received by sellers (Gillespie pp. 137-8).</p>
<p></p>
<p>So, taxes decrease the quantity produced and lead to </p>
<p>underproduction.</p>
<p></p>
<p><i>Subsidies, </i>on the other hand, lower the prices paid by buyers </p>
<p>and increase the prices received by sellers (Gillespie pp. 139-</p>
<p>40).</p>
<p></p>
<p>So, subsidies increase the quantity produced and lead to </p>
<p>overproduction.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p><b>Effect of indirect tax</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>An <b>indirect tax </b>must be paid by the supplier</p>

<p><b>2. The Free Market </b></p>
<p><b>System</b></p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p><b>Advantages of the </b></p>
<p><b>free market system </b></p>
<p></p>
<p>In a free market, decisions about what to produce are </p>
<p>determined by supply and demand (Gillespie p. 149).</p>
<p></p>
<p>In theory, i.e. based on “strong assumptions”, the free market </p>
<p><b>maximises social welfare </b>(social marginal benefit = social </p>
<p>marginal cost) i.e. maximises community surplus (Gillespie pp. </p>
<p>150-3)</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p><b>Advantages of the free market system</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Consumer surplus </b>measures the difference between what a </p>
<p>consumer is willing to pay for a product and what he or she </p>
<p>actually pays</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Producer surplus </b>measures the difference between the price </p>
<p>producers are willing to sell at and the price they actually </p>
<p>receive</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Community surplus </b>= consumer surplus + producer surplus</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p><b>Consumer surplus</b></p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p><b>Producer surplus</b></p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p><b>Examples </b></p>
<p></p>
<p>These concepts are best explained with reference to an </p>
<p>example. Consider the following demand curve for pizza:</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p><b>Consumer Surplus</b></p>
<p><b>1.</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The market price of a pizza is $10.</p>
<p><b>2.</b> At this price people buy 10,000 </p>
<p>pizzas</p>
<p><b>3. </b>But people are willing to pay $15 </p>
<p>for the 5,000</p>
<p>th</p>
<p> pizza, so consumer </p>
<p>surplus from that pizza is $5.</p>
<p>4. People are also willing to pay </p>
<p>$17.5 for the 2,500</p>
<p>th</p>
<p> pizza, etc. etc.. </p>
<p>We need to add the whole area to </p>
<p>which this applies…</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p><b>Total Consumer Surplus</b></p>
<p>    Total consumer surplus </p>
<p>from the 10,000 pizzas </p>
<p>that people buy is the </p>
<p>area of the green triangle.</p>
<p>(This relates to all </p>
<p>the pizzas that people </p>
<p>would have been willing </p>
<p>and able to buy at prices </p>
<p>above $10 per pizza, yet </p>
<p>did not have to. Hence </p>
<p>the term consumer </p>
<p>surplus)</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p><b>Producer Surplus</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>To demonstrate <i><b>producer surplus </b></i>now consider the following </p>
<p>supply curve for pizza:</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p><b>Producer Surplus</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>The producer surplus is shown by the blue shaded area; this is </p>
<p>the difference between the price producers are willing to sell </p>
<p>at (a shown by supply curve) and the price they actually </p>
<p>receive (market price)</p>
<p> </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p><b>Maximising Social Welfare</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>It is sometimes said that social welfare is maximised in a free </p>
<p>market (though this is based on strong assumptions):</p>
<p></p>
<p>At equilibrium, the quantity supplied = the quantity demanded</p>
<p></p>
<p>This means that the extra benefit to society of the last unit </p>
<p>produced and sold = the extra cost to society of that unit:</p>
<p>Social marginal benefit = Social marginal cost</p>
<p></p>
<p>Therefore, the welfare of society will not change if an extra </p>
<p>unit is produced – this means welfare must be maximised.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p><b>The free market may maximise social welfare</b></p>
<p>On all units up to the point Q1 </p>
<p>the extra social benefit is </p>
<p>greater than the extra social </p>
<p>cost of providing it:</p>
<p>SMB &gt; SMC</p>
<p>Therefore society as a whole </p>
<p>will gain from these units being </p>
<p>produced and consumed.</p>
<p>On all units beyond Q1, SMB &lt; </p>
<p>SMC therefore society would </p>
<p>lose out if these units were </p>
<p>produced.</p>
<p>Hence equilibrium occurs at </p>
<p>SMC = SMB and the welfare to </p>
<p>society is maximised.</p>

<p><b>The free market may </b></p>
<p><b>maximise social welfare</b></p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p><b>Disadvantages of the </b></p>
<p><b>market system</b></p>
<p>(Gillespie pp. 154-70)</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Monopoly power: </b>a firm dominates a market</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Externalities: </b>divergence between private and social </p>
<p>costs and benefits</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Merit goods: </b>society believes is more beneficial than </p>
<p>individuals do.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Public goods: </b>non-diminishable and non-excludable - </p>
<p> once produced available to everyone</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Income inequality</b></p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p><b>Monopoly power</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>So far we have assumed that market forces are allowed to operate, </p>
<p>and that these will enable equilibrium at Q1 and P1 (Point E).</p>
<p></p>
<p>However, in some markets, some firms might become dominant and </p>
<p>exert ‘monopoly power’.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A monopolist is a price setter. </p>
<p></p>
<p>It might decide to restrict output and push up the price (shown on </p>
<p>next slide – movement from Point E (Q1/P1) to Point B (Q2/P2).</p>
<p></p>
<p>This has the effect of eroding consumer surplus, with an associated </p>
<p>increase in producer surplus.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thus although the community surplus (the aggregate of consumer </p>
<p>and producer surplus) is unchanged it is now weighted in favour of </p>
<p>the producer.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p><b>Monopoly power</b></p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p><b>Externalities</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>In a free market, individuals pursue their own self-interests.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This means that their choices might not be those that are </p>
<p>optimal for society as a whole. </p>
<p>e.g. If you are considering whether or not to have the flu </p>
<p>vaccine, you will consider your own self interests and not </p>
<p>the </p>
<p>potential benefits to others if you were vaccinated.</p>
<p>  However, in preventing the spread of infection, the social   </p>
<p> </p>
<p>benefits of the vaccine exceed the private benefits.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is known as a <i><b>positive consumption externality; </b></i>the </p>
<p>product is under-consumed relative to what is socially optimal: </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p><b>Positive externality</b></p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p><b>Negative Externality</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>It can also be the case that the social benefits of consumption </p>
<p>are less than the private benefits. </p>
<p>For example, if a factory produces carbon emissions that </p>
<p>are harmful to the environment. This might be the </p>
<p>cheapest/ easiest and hence favourable means of emission </p>
<p>for the factory but the impact on society (the cost) as a </p>
<p>whole exceeds the benefits to the factory.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thus there is said to be a <i><b>negative externality of </b></i></p>
<p><i><b>consumption, </b></i>meaning too much of the product is </p>
<p>produced/consumed relative to what is optimal for society:</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p><b>Negative externality</b></p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p><b>Merit Goods</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>A <i><b>merit good </b></i>is one which society believes is more beneficial than </p>
<p>private individuals do.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We discussed this in Week 1 lecture when I explained that, left to </p>
<p>their own devices, individuals would have a tendency to under-</p>
<p>consume in areas such as education/health.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is similar to a positive externality, but merit goods occur </p>
<p>specifically because the government has superior knowledge of the </p>
<p>effects of these products.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Examples include the government sponsoring education, health, </p>
<p>museums, art galleries, etc. because they are deemed good for </p>
<p>society.</p>
<p></p>
<p><i><b>Demerit goods </b></i>are products that we consume without appreciating </p>
<p>the harm they create, for example, cigarettes, some drugs.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p><b>Public Goods</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>A <i><b>public-good </b></i>is defined as one that is non-diminishable and </p>
<p>non-excludable. This means that, once it is provided, </p>
<p>regardless of how many people consume it, it will be available </p>
<p>to everyone. Examples include traffic lights/police </p>
<p>patrols/open wifi networks, public conveniences, parks, etc.  </p>
<p></p>
<p>The problem with public goods is that no one would be willing </p>
<p>to pay for them since they would be provided anyway. This is </p>
<p>known as the <i><b>free-rider </b></i>problem; people will wait for </p>
<p>someone else to pay for the product, knowing that they will be </p>
<p>able to ‘free-ride’ and benefit without paying.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p><b>Income Inequality</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Final disadvantage of free market system is that it may lead to </p>
<p>income inequality.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Some people will earn high incomes if they have </p>
<p>products/skills which are in demand and others will earn very </p>
<p>little e.g. QS versus others!!  Others vs QSs!!</p>
<p></p>
<p>This may well be economically efficient but is it fair?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Society might wish the Government to do something about </p>
<p>income distribution.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is why we see Governments providing specific </p>
<p>welfare/benefits, to redress income inequalities that are </p>
<p>arguably unjust.</p>
