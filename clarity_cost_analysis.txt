**Level 1-2 (40% of usage - GPT-3.5)**
- Documents: 50 users × 15 docs × 40% = 300 documents
- Input: 5,000 tokens × 300 docs × $0.0005/1K tokens = $0.75 ≈ £0.59
- Output: 2,500 tokens × 300 docs × $0.0015/1K tokens = $1.13 ≈ £0.88
- Subtotal: £1.47/month

**Level 3 (30% of usage - Mixed Models)**
- Documents: 50 users × 15 docs × 30% = 225 documents
- GPT-3.5 (70%):
  - Input: 5,000 tokens × 225 docs × 70% × $0.0005/1K tokens = $0.39 ≈ £0.30
  - Output: 2,500 tokens × 225 docs × 70% × $0.0015/1K tokens = $0.59 ≈ £0.46
- GPT-4 (30%):
  - Input: 5,000 tokens × 225 docs × 30% × $0.03/1K tokens = $10.13 ≈ £7.90
  - Output: 2,500 tokens × 225 docs × 30% × $0.06/1K tokens = $10.13 ≈ £7.90
- Subtotal: £16.56/month

**Level 4-5 (30% of usage - GPT-4)**
- Documents: 50 users × 15 docs × 30% = 225 documents
- Input: 5,000 tokens × 225 docs × $0.03/1K tokens = $33.75 ≈ £26.33
- Output: 2,500 tokens × 225 docs × $0.06/1K tokens = $33.75 ≈ £26.33
- Subtotal: £52.66/month

**Total Paid Tier OpenAI Cost: £70.69/month**

### 3. Total Monthly Costs
- Infrastructure: £14.04/month
- Free Tier (Text Transformer): £2.15/month

## Cost Per User Analysis

### Free Tier Users (Text Transformer only)
- Cost per user: £2.15 ÷ 100 users = £0.02/user/month

### Paid Tier Users (Clarity Lectures)
- OpenAI cost per paid user: £70.69 ÷ 50 users = £1.41/user/month
- Infrastructure cost allocation per paid user: £14.04 ÷ 50 users = £0.28/user/month
- **Total cost per paid user: £1.69/user/month**

### Revenue Per Paid User
- Revenue: £4.99/user/month
- Cost: £1.69/user/month
- **Profit per paid user: £3.30/user/month**

## Scaling Analysis

### At 100 Paid Users
- Revenue: 100 × £4.99 = £499/month
- OpenAI costs: £70.69 × 2 = £141.38/month
- Infrastructure: £20/month (slight increase)
- **Profit: ~£337.62/month**

### At 500 Paid Users
- Revenue: 500 × £4.99 = £2,495/month
- OpenAI costs: £70.69 × 10 = £706.90/month
- Infrastructure: ~£50/month (increased Railway tier)
- **Profit: ~£1,738.10/month**

## Recommendations Based on Higher Usage

1. **Tiered Pricing Strategy**
   - Consider a tiered pricing model:
     - Basic: £4.99/month for 5 documents
     - Standard: £7.99/month for 15 documents
     - Premium: £12.99/month for unlimited documents

2. **Document Credits System**
   - Implement a credit system where:
     - £4.99 plan includes 5 document credits
     - Additional credits can be purchased (e.g., £0.75 per document)
     - Credits roll over for 3 months

3. **Cost Optimization Strategies**
   - Implement aggressive caching for document processing
   - Store processed documents to avoid reprocessing
   - Use GPT-3.5 for initial processing, only use GPT-4 for refinement
   - Implement token optimization techniques to reduce API costs

4. **Usage Analytics**
   - Monitor actual usage patterns closely
   - Identify power users who might benefit from higher tiers
   - Track which document types/sizes consume the most tokens

## Conclusion
Even with users processing 15 documents per month, the business model remains profitable with a 65% margin. The key is to implement proper usage limits or tiered pricing to ensure heavy users are paying appropriately for their consumption.

The £4.99/month price point provides good value to users while maintaining healthy profit margins. As the user base grows, economies of scale will further improve profitability through better infrastructure utilization.
